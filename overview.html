				What is Science Bowl?
			</h3>
			<p>
				<span class="tab"></span>Science Bowl is a competition run by the Department of Energy, a government department that also manages the United States’ energy supply and runs the national labs. Science Bowl is a team-based verbal buzzer competition. Teams of 5 students compete at the regional competition against other schools in our area: Miller, Stratford, and more. 
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">
				<span class="tab"></span>In the first half of the day, the “morning”, teams compete in round robin divisions to determine who makes it to the “afternoon” rounds. After lunch, teams compete in a double elimination bracket to determine the winner. The winning team gets a trip to Washington DC, where they face teams from across the US at nationals. 
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">
				<span class="tab"></span>There are 6 main subjects in the competition:
			</p>
			<ul style="margin-left: 2em;margin-top: 0px;">
				<li>Earth and Space: includes geology, landform geography, oceanography, astronomy, and more. </li>
				<li>Energy: focuses on research done by different national labs. </li>
				<li>General Science: an old category that no longer exists, covered lab procedures, and other general scientific topics (as the name suggests).</li>
				<li>Life Science: mainly biology, including simple molecular biology, cell biology, genetics, and more. </li>
				<li>Math: mainly topics seen in middle school math classes, including basic algebra, quadratics, statistics, and basic geometry. A background in competition math is very helpful.</li>
				<li>Physical Science: simple kinematics (motion), forces, and energy, as well as some nuclear physics. Also includes chemistry, although these two categories may have been split as of 2024.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>
				Rules
			</h3>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0px">
				<span class="tab"></span>Up to date rules can be found <a href="https://science.osti.gov/wdts/nsb/Regional-Competitions/Resources" target="_blank">here</a>. It is highly recommended that all participants read through the full rule book at least once, and do their best to understand all of it. This section will simply serve as a summary and refresher of the rules, as of 2024. A thorough knowledge of the rules will help with disputes during the rounds, and can often help you gain free points and win!  
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0px">
				<span class="tab"></span>Teams consist of up to five students, four of which play at any given time. The last member serves as a substitute: substitutions can only be made during halftime. Each school can send up to three teams, depending on space: usually, schools either receive one or two team slots. 
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0px">	
				<span class="tab"></span>There are two types of questions: tossups (4 points) and bonuses (10 points). Tossup questions can be answered by any actively playing member from either team. If a team answers a tossup question correctly, they get an exclusive chance to answer a bonus question (the other team cannot answer that bonus question). For tossup questions, NO VERBAL COMMUNICATION IS ALLOWED. Not only does this include speaking, but it also includes tapping, mouthing words, and other audible signals. It is OK to write down suggestions or answers on paper and show it to other team members. 
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0px">	
				<span class="tab"></span>For tossup questions, teams have up to 4 seconds after the question answers to "buzz in", which locks out the system and signals that they have an answer. After the moderator recognizes the team member, the member must prompty start their response: otherwise, it is considered a "stall" and is considered incorrect. If a member says the answer after buzzing but before being recognized, it is considered a "blurt" and is also automatically incorrect. After a team gets a tossup incorrect, no other members can buzz again, and the other team has 4 more seconds to buzz in. If both teams get the question incorrect, or time expires, the bonus is skipped and the next tossup is read. 
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0px">	
				<span class="tab"></span>If a team knows an answer partway through a question, they may choose to "interrupt" the moderator and buzz before the moderator is done talking. If they get the question correct, they get the usual 4 points and the chance for the bonus. If they get the question incorrect, stall, or blurt, there is a 4 point penalty awarded to the other team, and the entire question is reread. Therefore, interrupting is risky, but especially at high levels of play is almost necessary to win. 
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0px">	
				<span class="tab"></span>Bonus questions are usually more difficult than tossup questions, but more time is allocated, and team members may discuss answers amongst themselves. Bonuses are worth 10 points, and teams have 20 seconds after the moderator finishes reading to answer. After 15 seconds have passed after the question has been read, a 5 second warning will be given. A bonus can ONLY be answered by the TEAM CAPTAIN. The captain does not buzz in, but instead looks directly and the moderator and gives the answer. 
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0px">	
				<span class="tab"></span>Each tossup and bonus question is also either a "multiple choice" or "short answer" question. A multiple choice question has choices of W, X, Y, or Z. A team can either choose to use the letter or the EXACT phrase that follows the letter. For example, if the correct answer is "W) Between Mars and Jupiter", then "W", "W) Between Mars and Jupiter" and "Between Mars and Jupiter" would all be acceptable, but "Between Jupiter and Mars", "W) Between Jupiter and Mars", etc. would be incorrect.
