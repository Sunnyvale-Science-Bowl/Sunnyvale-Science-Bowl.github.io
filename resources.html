				How to study?
			</h3>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0px">
				<span class="tab"></span>It can feel overwhelming to study for everything that can be covered in Science Bowl. Luckily, you don't have to! Science Bowl is a team activity, and each member will learn a couple subjects. As a reminder, Science Bowl covers the following subjects:
			</p>
			<ul style="margin-left: 2em;margin-top: 0px;">
				<li>Earth and Space</li>
				<li>Energy (national lab research)</li>
				<li>General Science</li>
				<li>Life Science</li>
				<li>Math</li>
				<li>Physical Science (physics and chemistry)</li>
			</ul>
			<p style="margin-bottom:0px">
				<span class="tab"></span>Earth and Space has few calculation based questions, and instead focuses mainly on overall knowledge. Possible questions could cover geology (types of rocks, formation, and structures), plate techtonics, weather, and astronomy, though this is by no means a complete list. If you school provides a textbook on Earth sciences, this is a good starting place, though be on the lookout for potentially out of date information. CK12 also has a free textbook online which you can look at. 
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom:0px">
				<span class="tab"></span>It is very difficult to study for Energy questions, and there isn't any real benefit. Energy questions relate to research done at national labs: a typically question might start with "Researchers at Sandia National Lab are studying the properties of superconductors..." In the past, Energy questions also included renewable vs nonrenewable energy sources and related statistics: this is still good to know. Present day Energy questions, while relating to national lab research, can still be answered with knowledge from different topics, usually Life Science or Physical Science. That being said, it can still be a good idea to occasionally look at the websites: maybe you will find something interesting!
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom:0px">
				<span class="tab"></span>General Science no longer exists, but it is still good to know the related topics. General Science covered mainly laboratory equipment and procedures, as well as other topics. 
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom:0px">
				<span class="tab"></span>Life Science is one of the main places teams often drop points. Especially with complicated hormones and very specific questions, Life Science can be rough. Luckily, a basic but thorough knowledge of Life Science is usually good enough to start. Reading through your school's textbook is a great starting place (though again be on the lookout for outdated information). For complete knowledge, Campbell Biology is challenging, but thorough, and will contain everything that needs to be known. 
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom:0px">
				<span class="tab"></span>Out of these subjects, math is probably the easiest to fully learn. Learning up until Algebra 1 and Geometry will be a great start, and all that remains is honing speed. Studying for math competitions is also an excellent way to prepare for Science Bowl: the depth of knowledge required for math competitions is substantially greater, which means there will be few, if any, questions that you don't know how to solve. In addition, competitions like Mathcounts and the AMC 8 build speed, which is very important in later rounds against difficult competitors. For learning Algebra 1 and Geometry, try Khan Academy. For learning competition math, check out Sunnyvale Middle School's Math Club.  
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom:0px">
				<span class="tab"></span>Physical Science has two main parts: Physics and Chemistry. Physics involves kinematics, forces, and energy, as well as some rotational problems and theoretical questions. Occasionally, there may be some questions on optics. Particle physics also appears, but can be considered mostly separate. For physical science, start with the textbook assigned by your school, then move on to the basics covered in AP Physics 1 (check out Khan Academy, for example). Chemistry is usually a bit more challenging: questions do not especially involve calculations, apart from the occasional balancing question, so mostly be familiar with terminology and molecular names. 
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom:0px">
				<span class="tab"></span>There are practice questions on the official website, but I would like to strongly caution against using solely these questions to practice. These questions do not give the big picture, and only test specific pieces of knowledge. If you study from questions, you will have sporadic knowledge, which will not succeed in the actual competition, especially in elims. Of course, after reading, it is important to practice in order to get the hang of buzzing.
