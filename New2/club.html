			<h3>
				What do we do in Science Bowl Club?
			</h3>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0px">
				<span class="tab"></span>We do a couple of different things throughout the school year. 
			</p>
			<ul style="margin-left: 2em;margin-top: 0px;">
				<li>Weekly practices to prepare for the regional competition</li>
				<li>Buzzer practice and quizzes</li>
				<li>Host speakers and activities</li>
				<li>Science Fair (possibly)</li>
			</ul>
			<p style="margin-bottom:0px">
				<span class="tab"></span>Most meetings, we have one or two lectures to start the meeting, which can be followed by an activity (like a short worksheet or Kahoot). At the end of the meeting, we do buzzer practice, which gives an opportunity to test knowledge and practice with the system. Around November, we hold team selection tests: a written portion, listening portion, and buzzing portion are all used together to determine team members. 
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom:0px">
				<span class="tab"></span>During the 2023-2024 school year, meetings took place from 4-6pm, usually in Room A2. For the 2024-2025 school year, the information will likely be similar, but be sure to sign up with the google form on the home page of this website to be placed on our email list!
